* USEFUL HOTKEYS

    you can navigate playlist with arrow keys.

    PgUp, PgDn, Home, End also work.

    use above with Shift key to select multiple tracks.

    playback is controlled Winampâ„¢-style.
    Z, X, C, V, B, N keys are mapped to following actions:
    previous, play, pause, stop, next, random.

    also notice hotkey hints in the menus.

    it is not (yet?) possible to remap keys.

* CONFIGURATION

    since 0.3.0 release, all configuration is stored in single file:
    $HOME/.config/deadbeef/config

    you need to exit player before editing this file, or your changes will be overwritten.

    most stuff can be configured through edit->preferences dialog.

* ALBUM ART DISPLAY

    to display album artwork, you need to follow the steps below

    1. add new column, select Album Art type
    2. right click on the playlist column headers, and in context menu select "group by" submenu. click "Artist/Date/Album".

* OSD NOTIFICATIONS

    you can enable/configure them in "OSD Notify" plugin options

* CUESHEETS

    to load image+cue rips, you need to open/add actual image files, and Deadbeef will find the right .cue file automatically.

    you should not try to add .cue files to playlist

    example:

    Unknown Artist - Unknown Album.flac <---- open this file
    Unknown Artist - Unknown Album.cue  <---- this file will be used automatically

* KNOWN ISSUES

    GLOBAL HOTKEYS

    configuration is buggy when using GTK3, this is a GTK3 bug:
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=682826
    there's a work-around: if the key combination field doesn't work, change to a different tab in the preferences dialog, and then back -- it should start working again.

    FFMPEG

    the ffmpeg developers have been breaking their APIs many times before, and we were fixing the plugin again ang again, but this time (ffmpeg-0.11) they broke it in a way which makes it impossible to use together with deadbeef libmms plugin.
    currently, if you need MMS+WMA playback (or any other functionality that requires ffmpeg), you can compile deadbeef manually with --enable-ffmpeg, if you have ffmpeg<=0.10 installed.
    or you can use the statically-linked ffmpeg plugin, which can be found in any of the static builds provided on the official deadbeef website.
